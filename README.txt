First Update Number for Complete Persistent Data Structres is 0.

Position in the Data Structres is 1-indexed.

After Each Update in the Complete Persistent Data Structres, it shows the update number made. 
For new query on this updated version, use the Update number showed on screen.

I am not providing test cases as the UI is Menu driven, so it is easy for user to consume it. Also due to the time constraints.

For Heterogeneous Data Structres, user needs cast the pointers appropiately.

I had thought of creating the update tree for Complete Persistent Data Structres, which would have been helpful for the user to track the Structure itself.
But due to the time constraints, I could not do it. Sorry.

Almost All of the Data Structres are Optimally made persistent.
